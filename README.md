## Gameplay
The player holding the 2 of clubs after the pass makes the opening lead.

Each player must follow suit if possible. If a player is void of the suit led, a card of any other suit may be discarded. The highest card of the suit led wins a trick and the winner of that trick leads next. There is no trump suit.
